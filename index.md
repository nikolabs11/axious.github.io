- [Introduction to Bitcoin: what is bitcoin and why does it matter? | 37:16 | Sep 24, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1si5ZWLgy0) <br> Bitcoin is a mathematically secure software created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. No one knows who they are. I use they because Satoshi can be a man, woman, non binary or more than one person.  It does not matter who Satoshi Nakamoto is. Bitcoin has no central point of control. Bitcoin is the most powerful computer network on the planet. Bitcoin is the best performing asset over the last year, 5 years, and 10 years. 1 sat = 0.00000001 bitcoin.

- [Bitcoin and the Coming Infrastructure Inversion | 27:02 | Apr 4, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXIaILHl7Rg) <br> Andreas Antonopoulos is a computer scientists and data communications and distributed systems expert. The original video was published on YouTube on April 4, 2016 with an additional thirty minutes of Q&A, this updated version cuts out the Q&A and adds some animations. Much of what Andreas Antonopoulos predicted will happen with bitcoin is currently taking place (i.e. JP Morgan, Visa, PayPal, Cashapp, Square, Microstrategy, ln Strike, the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China, etc.)

- [Bitcoin Q&A: The 21 Million Supply Cap | 5:11 | Aug 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AABkJ55Zz3A) <br> [Bitcoin Q&A: What Exactly is the Halving? | 3:33 | May 6, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVCIhBEqgNE) <br> There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin. Every 210,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years) the output of bitcoin is cut in half. Each block mined and added to the blockchain originally rewarded 50 bitcoin released per block and is now at 6.125 bitcoin per block mined.
